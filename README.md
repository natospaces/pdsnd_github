### Description
Project is about using **Python** to compute usage patterns by exploring **United States bike share data** provided by Motivate. Program uses randomly selected data of three major cities, that is **Chicago, New York City**, and **Washington**.

Program reads data from a **Sqlite database** which provides statistical information on these metrics

* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration between stations
* Bike user information
